// Idea: schedule command takes in a function pointer. Then, a new command scheduler
// structure should be created, containing a serial number, the function pointer,
// and an Status containing the completion status. When a command is scheduled to run with
// the schedule_command() function, the unique serial number is returned. When a job is scheduled and
// run, it is popped off the queue, and the status variable associated with the structure is
// updated. Finally, the structure is pushed onto another vector containing completed jobs.
// the number of completed jobs that are stored is limited to a predefined number.
// Finally, there should be a function that takes argument for a serial number associated
// with a command, and returns the completion status.
